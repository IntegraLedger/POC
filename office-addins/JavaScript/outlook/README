This is the first version of the Integra Add-In for Outlook.

This uses the JavaScript API; it is not a VSTO plugin.

At present, side-loading this plugin into the local desktop Outlook
application is known to have iteration issues; that is, the prior,
obsolete build may still be in use when Outlook launches.  I am trying to
to pursue this problem with Microsoft.
