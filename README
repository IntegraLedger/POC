Integra Proof-of-Concept projects.

Standards for Proof-of-Concepts are as follows:

1. Rapidly demonstrate that the SDK and API for a target technology seem to
   work properly.

2. Rapidly demonstrate that we can probably integrate with that technology.

3. Demonstrate, or meaningfully simulate, a rational business case using
   the technology.

4. Report progress at daily standups unless otherwise directed.

5. If you are the only one working on a POC, check in progress as you make
   it-- at least daily.  If you are working with others, avoid breaking the
   build but do not wait longer than a few days to check in your work.

6. Maintain a README file for each project that explains what it is and how
   to build it.
